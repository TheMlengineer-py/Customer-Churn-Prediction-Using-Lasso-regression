# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Lasso-regression
. How do different customer demographics and purchase behaviors contribute to customer churn rate and product retention rate, and which variables have the strongest predictive power for these outcomes?
2. The goal of the churn data analysis and KNN classification task  is to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn rate and to develop strategies to reduce churn rate, increase product retention rate. By analysing customer data, organizations can gain insights into the patterns and trends that are associated with customer attrition, such as changes in purchase behavior, usage patterns, customer demographics, and other relevant data points.
Part II: Method Justification
B1. Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that is used for feature selection and regularization. In the context of customer churn rate and product retention rate analysis, lasso regression can be used to identify which customer demographic and purchase behavior variables are most strongly associated with these outcomes, and to estimate the strength of these associations.
The expected outcome of the lasso regression analysis is a set of regression coefficients for each independent variable in the model (such as  Contract, product usage, payment method, PaperlessBilling, Onlinesecurity, Gender, Age, Area,Employment, PaymentMethodetc.), which represent the estimated effect of that variable on the outcome variable (i.e., customer churn rate or product retention rate). The coefficients are estimated in such a way as to balance the model's goodness of fit (i.e., how well the model predicts the outcome variable) with its complexity (i.e., the number of independent variables included in the model). Lasso regression achieves this balance by applying a penalty term to the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients, which encourages the model to shrink coefficients that are not strongly associated with the outcome variable to zero.
By applying lasso regression to a customer dataset, it is possible to identify which customer demographics and purchase behavior variables are most strongly associated with customer churn rate and product retention rate. This information can then be used to develop targeted strategies for improving customer retention and reducing churn, based on the factors that are most strongly associated with these outcomes.


1 The accuracy of a lasso regression model cannot be evaluated using traditional classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score as it is a regression model and not a classification model. Instead, the performance of a lasso regression model can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
The MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The lower the value of MSE, the better the model's performance. In this case, the MSE value is 0.322, which suggests that the model's predictions are on average off by about 0.32 units.
The RMSE is the square root of the MSE and provides a measure of the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values, considering the units of the variable. The lower the RMSE, the better the model's performance. In this case, the RMSE value is 0.568, which suggests that the model's predictions are on average off by about 0.57 units.
The MAE is a measure of the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The lower the value of MAE, the better the model's performance. In this case, the MAE value is 0.497, which suggests that the model's predictions are on average off by about 0.50 units.
Finally, the AUROC is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances, and it ranges from 0 to 1. An AUROC value of 0.5 suggests that the model is performing no better than random chance. In this case, the AUROC value is 0.5, which suggests that the model is not performing well in distinguishing between positive and negative instances.
MSE( Mean squared error): 0.3228752599309099.
RMSE(Root Mean squared error): 0.5682211364696933
MAE (Mean absolute error): 0.49712922469882587.
AUROC (Area under roc curve): 0.5 
E2. Overall, the model's performance is not very good, as indicated by the high RMSE and MAE values and the low AUROC value. This suggests that the model is not accurately predicting the customer churn rate and product retention rate based on the input variables.
E3. limitation of lasso regression analysis is that it assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable. If the relationship is nonlinear, the model may not accurately capture the relationship and may produce inaccurate predictions. In addition, the lasso regression model assumes that the input variables are independent of each other, which may not always be the case in real-world situations.
In the results provided above, the AUROC value is 0.5, which suggests that the model is not performing well in distinguishing between positive and negative instances. This may indicate that the model is not capturing the true relationship between the input variables and the output variable, leading to inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the relatively high MSE, RMSE, and MAE values suggest that the model is not accurately predicting the customer churn rate and product retention rate, indicating that the model may not be capturing the complex relationship between the input variables and the output variable. These limitations suggest that the lasso regression model may not be the best choice for analysing customer churn data, and other more advanced models may need to be explored to accurately predict customer churn and retention rates.
